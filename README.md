Project Showcase: Spotify Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project analyzing Spotify music dataset! This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of song metrics, artist stats, and popularity trends for 2023-2024.

Technical Highlights: 
✅ Data Modeling: Cleaned and transformed raw data to build a star schema. 
✅ DAX Implementation: Created measures for 'Average Duration', 'Total Explicit Songs', and time-intelligence calculations. 
✅ Visual Design: Implemented a custom background and interactive slicers for a seamless user navigation experience. 
✅ Insights: Uncovered that "Album" releases significantly outnumber "Singles," and identified key seasonal trends in song popularity.
✅ Custom UI/UX: Designed a "Dark Mode" layout to mirror the native Spotify app experience.
✅ Trend Analysis: Visualized seasonality in song releases (peaking in July/Oct) and the split between Singles vs. Albums.

Building this project challenged me to move beyond standard visuals and focus on storytelling and user experience.
